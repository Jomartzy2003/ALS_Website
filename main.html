            <header>ALS 2.0</header>
            <p>The Alternative Learning System (ALS) is a parallel learning system in the Philippines that provides opportunities for</p>
            <p>out-of-school youth and adult (OSYA) learners to develop basic and functional literacy skills, and to access</p>
            <p>equivalent pathways to complete basic education.</p>
            </br>
            <p>A viable alternative to the existing formal education system, ALS encompasses both non-formal and informal</p>
            <p>sources of knowledge and skills. As a second chance education program, it aims to empower OSYA learners to</p>
            <p>continue learning in a manner, time and place suitable to their preference and circumstances, and for them to</p>
            <p>achieve their goals of improving their quality of life and becoming productive contributors to society.</p>
            </br>
            <p>In 2016, the ALS Program began undergoing reforms as part of strengthening, intensifying, and expanding its</p>
            <p>implementation. Three years of consultation, review and development of policies, training, and evaluation with</p>
            <p>partners in the government, local and international non-government agencies, and civil society organizations led to</p>
            <p>the finalization of the enhanced ALS K to 12 Basic Education Curriculum, the development of the ALS Program 2.0,</p>
            <p>and the rollout of the five-year<a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02142020_als_roadmap_maroon.pdf"> ALS 2.0 Strategic Roadmap.</a></p>
            </br>
            <p>In 2022, the DepEd Bureau of Alternative Education (BAE), in partnership with SEAMEO Innotech and USAID</p>
            <p>Opportunity 2.0, launched the <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ALS-Handbook-V1-220111.pdf"> ALS Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System Operations Handbook</a> to help </p>
            <p>the Department in determining the effectiveness of the Program in meeting its desired outcomes and targets based</p>
            <p>on approved plans.</p>
            </br>
            <p>In 2022, DepEd and UNICEF launched two new ALS publications: The <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ALS-Strategic-Plan-V6-Final-Web.pdf">ALS ICT Strategic Plan 2022-2026</a>, which </p>
            <p>concretizes the roles of ICT in the areas of access, quality and governance of the improved ALS Program; and</p>
            <p>the <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12222021_ALS_Research-Agenda.pdf">ALS Research Agenda 2022-2026</a>, which promotes evidence-based decision-making and policy development</p>
            <p>for the ALS program to achieve quality and inclusive lifelong learning and guides the research community in</p>
            <p>contributing to ALS research work.</p>
            </br>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.deped.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/ALS-Report-2023-Final.pdf"> ALS Report 2023</a> documents the incredible journey of fast-tracking the transformation of the ALS into a quality</p>
            <p>and relevant second chance basic education program from July 2016 to December 2022. It outlines the challenges</p>
            <p>faced and overcome, and details our results and accomplishments that we are proud to celebrate as an extended</p>
            <p>ALS family. It also contains a comprehensive set of recommendations for the remaining work to be undertaken to</p>
            <p>fully achieve the dream, documented in the 1986 Philippine Constitution, of an accessible, vibrant, responsive and</p>
            <p>quality ALS as a parallel pathway of learning for Filipino out-of-school youth and adults.</p>

            <header>THE ALS K TO 12 BASIC EDUCATION CURRICULUM</header>
            <p>The ALS Program uses a contextualized non-formal curriculum which is substantially aligned with the K to 12</p>
            <p>Curriculum for Basic Education of the formal school system, but it is not the mirror image of the formal school</p>
            <p>curriculum. It is aligned but not identical. This takes into account the prior learning of its learners and reflects the</p>
            <p>indicators of functional literacy into six interrelated learning strands.</p>
